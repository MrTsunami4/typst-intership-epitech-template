  abstract: [
    This report details a six-month internship at AeroTech Industries, focusing on the optimization of predictive maintenance algorithms for commercial aircraft. By implementing new Machine Learning techniques, false alerts were reduced by 14%. This document covers the technical context, the methodology used, and the results of the A/B testing phase.

  preamble: "This section is intended for a newcomer taking over the project. It describes the company context, the project's general architecture, and the work organization."
)

= Company Context
AeroTech Industries is a leader in aerospace engineering. The team I joined is responsible for the digital twin platform used to monitor aircraft health in real-time.

= Project Architecture
The project follows a microservices architecture. Data is ingested via MQTT, processed by a Spark cluster, and stored in a time-series database.

== Anomaly Detection Model
To process time-series data from engine sensors, we opted for an architecture based on Random Forests combined with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

def preprocess_sensor_data(df, window_size=50):
    # Remove extreme outliers
    df = df[(np.abs(df.temperature - df.temperature.mean()) <= (3 * df.temperature.std()))]

    # Normalize data
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    df['temp_scaled'] = scaler.fit_transform(df[['temperature']])

    # Create sliding windows for LSTM
    return df.rolling(window=window_size).mean()
```

= Methodology and Implementation
== Data Flow Diagram
The diagram below illustrates the data flow into the hybrid LSTM model.

// ==========================================

#part_page(
  "Part 2: Self-Assessment",
  preamble: "This section presents an argument to my supervisor regarding my performance, highlighting my strengths and areas for improvement."
)

= Strengths
- *Technical Adaptability:* I was able to quickly master the complex Spark infrastructure used at AeroTech.
- *Problem Solving:* I successfully identified a bottleneck in the data ingestion pipeline that was causing 5% data loss.

= Areas for Improvement
- *Communication:* I need to improve my ability to explain technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
- *Time Management:* During the first month, I struggled with prioritizing tasks, though this improved significantly later.

  "Part 3: Dream Project Pitch",
  preamble: "This section is designed to convince senior management to entrust me with a high-impact project."
)

= Context
With the rise of autonomous flight systems, there is a growing need for edge-computing anomaly detection.

= The Project: "EdgeGuard"
I propose developing a lightweight version of our LSTM model that can run directly on the aircraft's hardware (Edge AI), reducing latency and satellite bandwidth costs.

= Interest for the Company
Implementing EdgeGuard would reduce operational costs by 20% and provide real-time safety critical alerts without relying on ground connectivity.

// ==========================================
// CONCLUSION
// ==========================================

= Conclusion
This internship allowed me to apply theoretical Machine Learning concepts to critical industrial problems. The results obtained pave the way for a generalization of this approach to other aircraft sub-systems.
